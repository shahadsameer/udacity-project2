  "description": "**Memory game Cards** is a game that I created with the help of **Udacity**. It is a project that I must complete as part of the **Google Udacity FEND Nanodegree**. I decided to download the starter code that Udacity provided. This consisted of a HTML file, a CSS file, and a JavaScript file with one function in it (the shuffle function; I deleted  it and introduced my own). I have built most of the JavaScript functionality. I have made the page responsive (with media queries) to different size screens.",
